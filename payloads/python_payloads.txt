[*] Build an Executable
	We want an executable that has all dependencies built-in. Why? Most
Windows systems are not going to have Python installed. This can be a pro and
con.
		Pro: The OS is not looking for python
		Con: this may trigger AV
	In an attempt to build malware using python, we will build on Windows
to create a windows executable.

	> Install Python (Tested with 3.9+)
		https://www.python.org/downloads/
	> Install virtualenv
		pip install virtualenv
	> Create a directory, install a virtual environment, then source
		mkdir py_project
		cd py_project
		virtualenv env
		env\Scripts\activate.bat
	> clone your repo or use a python script
		git clone project
		cd project
	> Install the project
		pip install .
	> Now that all dependencies are built, create exe file.
		pip install pyinstaller
		pyinstalled -F script.py
	> Your .exe file is now in dist/ directory
	> deactivate your virtual environment, test the exe
		deactivate
		.\script.exe
