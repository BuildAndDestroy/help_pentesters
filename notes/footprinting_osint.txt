[*] Enumeration Principles

No.	Principle
1.	There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.
2.	Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.
3.	There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.


What can we see?
What reasons can we have for seeing it?
What image does what we see create for us?
What do we gain from it?
How can we use it?
What can we not see?
What reasons can there be that we do not see?
What image results for us from what we do not see?
