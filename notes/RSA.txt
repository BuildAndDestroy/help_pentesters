[*] Info about RSA:
	The key variables that you need to know about for RSA in CTFs are p, q, m, n, e, d, and c.
	“p” and “q” are large prime numbers, “n” is the product of p and q.
	The public key is n and d, the private key is n and e.
	“m” is used to represent the message (in plaintext) and “c” represents the ciphertext (encrypted text).
