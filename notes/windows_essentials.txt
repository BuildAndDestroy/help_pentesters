[*] Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)
	NTFS permissions on files and directories. Examples:
		icacls C:\Windows
	You will see shortened permissions like (CI).
	Use this list to check what perms this directory/file has:

		(CI): container inherit
		(OI): object inherit
		(IO): inherit only
		(NP): do not propagate inherit
		(I): permission inherited from parent container
		F : full access
		D :  delete access
		N :  no access
		M :  modify access
		RX :  read and execute access
		R :  read-only access
		W :  write-only access

	Example of granting and revoking permissions for a user:
		icacls C:\Users /grant user:f # Only grants access to current directory \Users
		icacls C:\Users /remove user
	More can be learned here:
	https://ss64.com/nt/icacls.html

	More file permissions:
		Full control
		Modify
		Read & execute
		List folders content
		Read
		Write
		Special permissions
	Explained:
		Full control - allows the user/users/group/groups to set the ownership of the folder, set permission for others, modify, read, write, and execute files.
		Modify - allows the user/users/group/groups to modify, read, write, and execute files.
		Read & execute - allows the user/users/group/groups to read and execute files.
		List folder contents - allows the user/users/group/groups to list the contents (files, subfolders, etc) of a folder.
		Read - only allows the user/users/group/groups to read files.
		Write - allows the user/users/group/groups to write data to the specified folder (automatically set when "Modify" right is checked).
		Note: You can allow or deny permissions for users or groups.
		To set permissions for a file or folder right click on the file and select "Properties". Go to the "Security" tab and click on the "Edit" button.

Directory               Function

Perflogs                Can hold Windows performance logs but is empty by default.

Program Files           On 32-bit systems, all 16-bit and 32-bit programs are installed here. 
                        On 64-bit systems, only 64-bit programs are installed here.

Program Files (x86)	    32-bit and 16-bit programs are installed here on 64-bit editions 
                        of Windows.

ProgramData             This is a hidden folder that contains data that is essential for 
                        certain installed programs to run. This data is accessible by the 
                        program no matter what user is running it.

Users                   This folder contains user profiles for each user that logs onto the 
                        system and contains the two folders Public and Default.

Default                 This is the default user profile template for all created users. 
                        Whenever a new user is added to the system, their profile is based on 
                        the Default profile.

Public                  This folder is intended for computer users to share files and is 
                        accessible to all users by default. This folder is shared over the 
                        network by default but requires a valid network account to access.

AppData                 Per user application data and settings are stored in a hidden user 
                        subfolder (i.e., cliff.moore\AppData). Each of these folders contains 
                        three subfolders. The Roaming folder contains machine-independent data
                        that should follow the user's profile, such as custom dictionaries. 
                        The Local folder is specific to the computer itself and is never 
                        synchronized across the network. LocalLow is similar to the Local 
                        folder, but it has a lower data integrity level. Therefore it can be 
                        used, for example, by a web browser set to protected or safe mode.

Windows                 The majority of the files required for the Windows operating system 
                        are contained here.

System, System32,
SysWOW64	            Contains all DLLs required for the core features of Windows and the 
                        Windows API. The operating system searches these folders any time a 
                        program asks to load a DLL without specifying an absolute path.

WinSxS                  The Windows Component Store contains a copy of all Windows components, 
                        updates, and service packs.


[*] NTFS File System Permissions

Permission Type	Description
Full Control	        Allows reading, writing, changing, deleting of files/folders.

Modify                  Allows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders.

List Folder Contents    Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as 
                        executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.

Read and Execute        Allows for viewing and listing files and subfolders as well as 
                        executing files. Files and folders inherit this permission.

Write                   Allows for adding files to folders and subfolders and writing 
                        to a file.

Read                    Allows for viewing and listing of folders and subfolders and 
                        viewing a file's contents.

Traverse Folder	        This allows or denies the ability to move through folders to reach 
                        other files or folders. For example, a user may not have permission 
                        to list the directory contents or view files in the documents or web 
                        apps directory in this example 
                        c:\users\bsmith\documents\webapps\backups\backup_02042020.zip but with
                        Traverse Folder permissions applied, they can access the backup archive.

[*] Active Directory Users
	Domain Admins - This is the big boss: they control the domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controller.
	Service Accounts (Can be Domain Admins) - These are for the most part never used except for service maintenance, they are required by Windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account
	Local Administrators - These users can make changes to local machines as an administrator and may even be able to control other normal users, but they cannot access the domain controller
	Domain Users - These are your everyday users. They can log in on the machines they have the authorization to access and may have local administrator rights to machines depending on the organization.


[*] Active Directory Groups
There are two overarching types of Active Directory groups: 
	Security Groups - These groups are used to specify permissions for a large number of users
	Distribution Groups - These groups are used to specify email distribution lists. As an attacker these groups are less beneficial to us but can still be beneficial in enumeration
Default Security Groups
	Domain Controllers - All domain controllers in the domain
	Domain Guests - All domain guests
	Domain Users - All domain users
	Domain Computers - All workstations and servers joined to the domain
	Domain Admins - Designated administrators of the domain
	Enterprise Admins - Designated administrators of the enterprise
	Schema Admins - Designated administrators of the schema
	DNS Admins - DNS Administrators Group
	DNS Update Proxy - DNS clients who are permitted to perform dynamic updates on behalf of some other clients (such as DHCP servers).
	Allowed RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group can have their passwords replicated to all read-only domain controllers in the domain
	Group Policy Creator Owners - Members in this group can modify group policy for the domain
	Denied RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group cannot have their passwords replicated to any read-only domain controllers in the domain
	Protected Users - Members of this group are afforded additional protections against authentication security threats. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=298939 for more information.
	Cert Publishers - Members of this group are permitted to publish certificates to the directory
	Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the domain
	Enterprise Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the enterprise
	Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the domain.
	Enterprise Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the forest.
	Cloneable Domain Controllers - Members of this group that are domain controllers may be cloned.
	RAS and IAS Servers - Servers in this group can access remote access properties of users

[*] Domain Trusts
	Trusts are a mechanism in place for users in the network to gain access to other resources in the domain. 
	There are two types of trusts that determine how the domains communicate. I'll outline the two types of trusts below:
		Directional - The direction of the trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain
		Transitive - The trust relationship expands beyond just two domains to include other trusted domains
	TL;DR Domains/Subdomains follow a trust to communicate from domain to domain. An external domain can be authorized via Trust to communicate within the domain and even within the domain forest.

[*] Domain Policies
	Examples:
		Disable Windows Defender - Disables windows defender across all machine on the domain
		Digitally Sign Communication (Always) - Can disable or enable SMB signing on the domain controller
	Think aout this like Puppet - Master says do X - Works will all obey

[*] Domain Services
	Default Domain Services
		LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; provides communication between applications and directory services
		Certificate Services - allows the domain controller to create, validate, and revoke public key certificates
		DNS, LLMNR, NBT-NS - Domain Name Services for identifying IP hostnames

		LDAP authentication is a popular mechanism with third-party (non-Microsoft) applications that integrate with AD. These include applications and systems such as:

		Gitlab
		Jenkins
		Custom-developed web applications
		Printers
		VPNs

[*] Domain Authentication
	Two main type:
		Kerberos - The default authentication service for Active Directory uses ticket-granting tickets and service tickets to authenticate users and give users access to other resources across the domain.
		NTLM - default Windows authentication protocol uses an encrypted challenge/response protocol

	New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is the suite of security protocols used to authenticate users' identities in AD. NTLM can be used for authentication by using a challenge-response-based scheme called NetNTLM. 
		Examples:
			Internally-hosted Exchange (Mail) servers that expose an Outlook Web App (OWA) login portal.
			Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service of a server being exposed to the internet.
			Exposed VPN endpoints that were integrated with AD.
			Web applications that are internet-facing and make use of NetNTLM.

[*] Windows Directories Explained
	PerfLogs - Stores the system issues and other reports regarding performance
	Program Files and Program Files (x86) - Is the location where programs install unless you change their path (Ex: Choosing to install software on D drive)
	Users - In this folder are stored the users created. It also stores users generated data (Ex: Saving a file on your Desktop)
	Windows - It's the folder which basically contains the code to run the operating system and some utility tools.
