[*] Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)
	NTFS permissions on files and directories. Examples:
		icacls C:\Windows
	You will see shortened permissions like (CI).
	Use this list to check what perms this directory/file has:

(CI): container inherit
(OI): object inherit
(IO): inherit only
(NP): do not propagate inherit
(I): permission inherited from parent container
F : full access
D :  delete access
N :  no access
M :  modify access
RX :  read and execute access
R :  read-only access
W :  write-only access

	Example of granting and revoking permissions for a user:
		icacls C:\Users /grant user:f # Only grants access to current directory \Users
		icacls C:\Users /remove user

[*] Windows Services
	Windows Services are controlled in the Service Control Manager (SCM), accessible via services.msc MMC addin.
	cmd tool is sc.exe
		sc query Appinfo
	Powershell cmdlet is Get-Service
		Get-Service
		Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"}
		Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | select -First 2 | fl
		cmd.exe /c sc query Appinfo

	Services below that are modified must go through a reboot to take effect:
Service				Description
smss.exe			Session Manager SubSystem. Responsible for handling sessions on the system.
csrss.exe			Client Server Runtime Process. The user-mode portion of the Windows subsystem.

svchost.exe with RPCSS		Manages system services that run from dynamic-link libraries (files with the extension .dll) such as
				"Automatic Updates," "Windows Firewall," and "Plug and Play." Uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) 
				Service (RPCSS).
svchost.exe with Dcom/PnP	Manages system services that run from dynamic-link libraries (files with the extension .dll) such as

[*] Directory Structure of Boot Partition
Directory               Function

Perflogs                Can hold Windows performance logs but is empty by default.

Program Files           On 32-bit systems, all 16-bit and 32-bit programs are installed here. 
                        On 64-bit systems, only 64-bit programs are installed here.

Program Files (x86)	    32-bit and 16-bit programs are installed here on 64-bit editions 
                        of Windows.

ProgramData             This is a hidden folder that contains data that is essential for 
                        certain installed programs to run. This data is accessible by the 
                        program no matter what user is running it.

Users                   This folder contains user profiles for each user that logs onto the 
                        system and contains the two folders Public and Default.

Default                 This is the default user profile template for all created users. 
                        Whenever a new user is added to the system, their profile is based on 
                        the Default profile.

Public                  This folder is intended for computer users to share files and is 
                        accessible to all users by default. This folder is shared over the 
                        network by default but requires a valid network account to access.

AppData                 Per user application data and settings are stored in a hidden user 
                        subfolder (i.e., cliff.moore\AppData). Each of these folders contains 
                        three subfolders. The Roaming folder contains machine-independent data
                        that should follow the user's profile, such as custom dictionaries. 
                        The Local folder is specific to the computer itself and is never 
                        synchronized across the network. LocalLow is similar to the Local 
                        folder, but it has a lower data integrity level. Therefore it can be 
                        used, for example, by a web browser set to protected or safe mode.

Windows                 The majority of the files required for the Windows operating system 
                        are contained here.

System, System32,
SysWOW64	            Contains all DLLs required for the core features of Windows and the 
                        Windows API. The operating system searches these folders any time a 
                        program asks to load a DLL without specifying an absolute path.

WinSxS                  The Windows Component Store contains a copy of all Windows components, 
                        updates, and service packs.


[*] NTFS File System Permissions

Permission Type	Description
Full Control	        Allows reading, writing, changing, deleting of files/folders.

Modify                  Allows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders.

List Folder Contents    Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as 
                        executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.

Read and Execute        Allows for viewing and listing files and subfolders as well as 
                        executing files. Files and folders inherit this permission.

Write                   Allows for adding files to folders and subfolders and writing 
                        to a file.

Read                    Allows for viewing and listing of folders and subfolders and 
                        viewing a file's contents.

Traverse Folder	        This allows or denies the ability to move through folders to reach 
                        other files or folders. For example, a user may not have permission 
                        to list the directory contents or view files in the documents or web 
                        apps directory in this example 
                        c:\users\bsmith\documents\webapps\backups\backup_02042020.zip but with
                        Traverse Folder permissions applied, they can access the backup archive.
