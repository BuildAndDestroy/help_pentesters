[*] What is Reverse Engineering (RE)?
	Understand the design
	Observe state of an object
	Determine how an object functions.
    So what is malware reverse engineering?
	Reveal malware design
	Identify malware code and architecture
	Catalogue the type of malware artifacts
    Malware Analysis
	Analyze Malware and how it works
	Reverse engineering could be a thing but not always
	Sometimes we just need to see how the malware works - workflow and processes
    Process Commonalities
	Static Analysis
		Object analysis without execution
	Dynamic Analysis
		Object with execution
    Why the hell are we analyzing malware? What's the benefit?
	TL;DR - Money
	Malware is always trending and the trend is growing.
	Knowing behavior, you can protect ecosystem with known tools or build tools.
    Reporting
	Document data collected - Why?
		Library of past and current issues or events
		Help analysts or upper management review findings
	Know your audience
		Not everyone technical
		High level and low level might not hit requirements.
	Management may dictate what's needed
		MY thoughts - maybe an executive review and a detailed view may help.

[*] Malware analysis tools
	Types of tools:
		Binary
		Disassemblers
		Decompilers
		Debuggers
		Monitoring Tools
	Binaries:
		First few bytes should be "magic headers"
			Example "PDF" or "MZ header"
	Disassemblers and Decompilers
		Disassemblers read low level assembly code of program
		Tools:
			Windows - IDA
			Linux - Ghidra
	Debuggers
		Allows analyst to navigate through code, line by line, as program is executed.
		Usually ran in a closed environment, especially malware.
	Monitoring Tools
		Monitors system, such as File system, Registry, Memory, Network, CPU and Processes.

		
[*] Malware handling
	Check the file hash
	Use protection, store the file in a zip file for example.
		This helps to avoid accidental execution and nuking your machine or lab.
		Once moved, you can unzip the file and recheck the hash
	Rename the file extension.
	Isolate the lab and disconnect network
		Avoid sharing networks to avoid anything getting out.
		Isolate lab so if something does execute, other machines are not compromised

[*] Malware Lab
	Host
	Guests (virtual machines)
		Windows 10
		REMnux Linux OS - Malware analysis linux OS
	*****SNAPSHOTS******
		Take snapshots before you investigate. A clean slate is nice.

[*] Operating Systems
	Know your environment that malware is going to go after.
	Windows:
		File System
			Data in format of files and directories
			File allocation table (FAT)
			New Technology File System (NTFS)
			ExFAT (Extensible File System)
			Resilient File System (ReFS)
			Linux (Newer file systems for embedded linux)
			Drectory Paths
			Filename
			File sizes
			Time, Date, Access stamps
			File Permissions
		Memory
		Registry
