[*] IDOR Tips
	User supplied data is usually at risk. Look in 3 main places:
		Query Component
			https://somedomain.com/test?id=1
				id=1 is a query component
		Post Variables
			Always look at POST fields. Forms, API's, etc as the end user can change these.
		Cookies
			User sessions stored as cookie, try to modify the cookie and access other's information
