[*] Download the developer version of FireFox and unzip the tar:
	https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/
	tar -xf firefox*.tar.bz2

[*] Set the SSLKEYLOGFILE variable to wherever you want your keys stored and run firefox dev version from terminal:
	# SSLKEYLOGFILE="/tmp/savedkeysfortcpdump" /path/to/dev/firefox

[*] In a separate terminal, collect your tcpdump.
	# tcpdump -i <DEVICE NAME LIKE eth0> -c 10000 -w /path/to/newfile.pcap

[*] Once done, you can now import the pcap to wireshark. In wireshark, import your SSLKEYLOGFILE:
	Edit > Preferences > Protocols > TLS > (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename
    Then click on a TLS packet and click on "Decrypted TLS" at the bottom of Wireshark
