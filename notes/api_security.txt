	Postman
		https://www.postman.com/
		Install
			wget -c https://dl.pstmn.io/download/latest/linux_64 -O postman-linux-x64.tar.gz
			sudo tar -zxvf postman-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /opt/
			sudo ln -s /opt/Postman/Postman /usr/bin/Postman
		Setup
			Far left nav bar, make sure you are in a Collection
			Top "Overview" Bar, hit the "+" for a new Request
	
		Environment Variables
			While in your "Request, look at the top right "No Environment". Click it and hit "Cntrl+N".
				Click on "Environment"
				Environment variables are used to persist across APIs. Think of "Global Reviews".
		CA Certificate
			Import the CA Certificate for Postman Proxy. This allows you to collect APIs as you browse the webapp.
				sudo find / -type f -name postman-proxy-ca.crt 2>/dev/null
			Assuming you are using Kali, you should see the file here:
				/home/kali/.config/Postman/proxy/postman-proxy-ca.crt
			Import this into your browser (Just like Burpsuite). Then enable the proxy in Postman:
				Setup a new Collection
				Bottom right you will see "Capture Requests", click it
				Save requests to a Collection, select the new Collection you created
				Click on "Enable Proxy", set port 5555
				Enable Proxy
				Start Capture
			In your browser, after importing the CA cert, enable FoxyProxy on port 5555
			Browse the web app.
			Go back through the collection and copy any json request to a new collection you want to save for later
	Common User Passwords Profiler (CUPP)

	Mentalist

	JWT Tool

	mitmweb
		Make sure to import the CA certificate using website "mitm.it"
			https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-certificates/
		Save the "flow" file to work with mitmproxy2swagger
	mitmproxy2swagger
		This one is very useful. Follow the readme on github to get up and running
			https://github.com/alufers/mitmproxy2swagger
		Using the "flow" file from mitmweb, example:
			mitmproxy2swagger -i flows -o spec.yaml -p https://subdomain.domain.com/api/v1 -f flow
		Now open a text editor, keeping all lines found, remove "ignore:" from lines we want to keep for our api testing.
		Rerun the same mitmproxy2swagger command above. This will update the "spec.yaml" file for use with swagger.
		Visit the following website to import your spec.yaml file. This will help visualize the API.

	crunch
		Used to generate passwords. Useful for cracking JWT tokens.
		Example:
			crunch 3 3 -o jwtlist.out
