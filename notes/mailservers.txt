[*] SMTP Commands

Command		Description
AUTH PLAIN	AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.
HELO		The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.
MAIL FROM	The client names the email sender.
RCPT TO		The client names the email recipient.
DATA		The client initiates the transmission of the email.
RSET		The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server.
VRFY		The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.
EXPN		The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.
NOOP		The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.
QUIT		The client terminates the session.


[*] Check for users via SMTP and Telnet
	Note: do not always trust this method. Throw junk names just to play it safe.
	252 means the user should exist. 250, they do not exist.

user@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 

VRFY root

252 2.0.0 root


VRFY cry0l1t3

252 2.0.0 cry0l1t3


VRFY testuser

252 2.0.0 testuser


VRFY aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

252 2.0.0 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa


[*] Proxy
	Sometimes we may have to work through a web proxy. We can also make this web proxy connect to the SMTP server. The command that we would send would then look something like this: CONNECT 10.129.14.128:25 HTTP/1.0


[*] Example sending an email:

user@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
