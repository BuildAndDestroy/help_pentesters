[*] Notes:
	Why are capabilities important? Sometime file perms and/or user options are not available. Docker/Kubernetes containers/pods are too restricted. But if you can change your namespaceyou may be able to attack on the kernel level. Assuming the pod is privileged, you may be able to pop root on host level, rather than the pod level.
